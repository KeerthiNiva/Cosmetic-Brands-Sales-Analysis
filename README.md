Cosmetics Brands Visualization

This project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Faker to generate synthetic data simulating sales and distribution metrics for cosmetics brands. The generated data is visualized using Tableau to explore key insights into the cosmetics industry, including sales analysis, geographical insights, brand comparison, and customer demographics. The interactive dashboard allows users to seamlessly navigate and analyze the data.
